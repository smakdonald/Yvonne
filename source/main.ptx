		<chapter xml:id="ch-0"><title>Introduction</title>

			<p>
				Notation is one of the unsung heroes of mathematics. 
				Good notation allows us to organize our thinking and opens the door to connections between ideas that we might not see otherwise. 
				Classical <q>power</q> notation is one of the best examples. 
				Originally introduced as a simple bookkeeping method in the 1600's, power notation opened up a new way of thinking as our understanding of real numbers grew; 
				and this new thinking ultimately led to powerful classes of functions that are essential tools in much of modern science.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let <m>a</m> be a number, and let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. We use the special symbol “<m>a^n</m>" to represent the number we reach using “repeated multiplication by <m>a</m>." 
				In particular, the symbol <m>a^n</m> is bookkeeping notation, simply telling us how many factors of <m>a</m> appear in the repeated multiplication: 
				<me>
					a^n=\underbrace{a\cdot a\cdot\dots \cdot a}_{n\ times}
				</me> 
				The superscript indicates the number of times <m>a</m> appears in the multiplication and is known as the <em>exponent</em>, from the Latin phrase <em>expo ponere</em> which means “out of place." 
				(Michael Stifel is credited with coining the term in the 1500's.) 
				The number <m>a</m> is now called the <em>base</em> of the expression.
			</p>

			<aside>
				<p>
					In the expression <m>a^n</m>, we say the <term>base</term> is <m>a</m>, the <term>exponent</term> is <m>n</m>. 
					The entire expression <m>a^n</m> is called a <term>power</term>.
				</p>

				<p>
					When <m>n \in \mathbb{N}^+</m>, we define <me>a^n=\underbrace{a\cdot a\cdot\dots \cdot a}_{n\ times}</me> with repeated multiplication by <m>a</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					When <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}</m>, we need to extend the definition of <m>a^n</m>. 
					We will do so in this chapter.
				</p>
			</aside>

			<p>
				The expression <m>a^n</m> is referred to as a <em>power</em> of <m>a</m>. 
				Use of this term to mean repeated multiplication by a number seems to be Greek in origin. 
				Euclid is known to have used this term (<em>dunamis</em> in Greek), and scholars attribute its first use to Hippocrates of Chios.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using superscripts to indicate repeated multiplication is an ancient idea, having first been introduced in very limited form by Diophantus nearly 2,000 years ago in his so-called <em>syncopated</em> algebra. 
				With the exception of using superscripts, Diophantus' notation bears little resemblance to our modern idea of exponents. 
				(For example, he used <m>\Delta^Y</m> to represent “the second power of an unknown" and <m>K^Y</m> to represent “the cube of an unknown.")
			</p>

			<p>
				The brilliant twelfth-century Muslim mathematician Ibn Yaha al-Maghribi Al-Samawa'al came close to developing modern power notation in his algebra text <em>al-Bahir fi'l-jabr</em> (The Brilliant in Algebra). 
				In many respects, this text was centuries ahead of its time, but it found little traction outside of the Islamic world. 
				Some of the ideas appearing in this work (such as polynomial division and considering <m>1/a</m> to be a power of <m>a</m>) would not be systematically tackled in the West until the 1600's.
			</p>

			<p>
				The fourteenth-century mathematician Nicolas Oresme is credited as the first Western mathematician to associate numbers with powers of <m>a</m>, although he did not use superscripts. Significantly, he is also the first individual to consider non-integer powers; 
				he did so in the context of music. 
				(We will have more to say about this later.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Modern power notation seems to have originated (at least in the West) in the fifteenth century through the work of Nicolas Chuquet, although it was not widely used until Renee Descartes popularized it in the 1600's.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have introduced the expression <m>a^n</m> as a bookkeeping symbol for repeated multiplication, we can think about productive ways to <em>extend</em> the meaning of this symbol. 
				Mathematicians often extend the meaning of a symbol using analogy. 
				Let's look at an example.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let “<m>a</m>" be a number. 
				We know that <m>(-1)a</m> represents the translation from “<m>a</m>" to “<m>0</m>"; 
				that is, we know that <m>a+(-1)a=0</m>. 
				In additive thinking, <em>multiplying</em> a real number by <m>-1</m> produces the additive inverse for <m>a</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's think about multiplication instead of addition. 
				The multiplicative inverse for any nonzero number <m>a</m> is defined to be <m>1/a</m>; 
				that is, we know <m>a\cdot(1/a)=1</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, proceeding by analogy, we could <em>define</em> <m>a^{-1}</m> as a symbol that stands for <m>1/a</m>. 
				By doing this, we would be letting <m>a^{-1}</m> serve a role in <em>multiplication</em> that is analogous to the role <m>-a</m> plays in <em>addition</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To see whether an extension is useful, we sometimes check whether it satisfies properties that the original use satisfies. 
				For powers, we would want to make sure that this new definition satisfies power properties such as the power of a power property (<m>(a^{x_1})^{x_2}</m>) or product of power property (<m>a^{x_1}a^{x_2}=a^{x_1+x_2}</m>).
			</p>

				<p>
				In <xref ref="part-i"/>, we:
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Review power properties
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Give a working definition for positive rational powers and integer powers
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Motivate why we need to be careful about our definitions for powers, especially regarding the possible values of the base and exponent.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				These ideas set up in <xref ref="part-ii" />, where we:
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Revisit the definitions
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Define real powers.

					<p>
						This activity uses a Three Act Math Task to motivate the material in this chapter. 
						Math Three Acts use mathematical storytelling to motivate learning. 
						Basically, Act I is meant to activate mathematical curiosity and set up a conflict / problem to solve, Act II develops tools for solving the conflict / problem, and Act III resolves the mathematical conflict / problem and sets up a sequel!

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In the sunglasses tasks, we used:
					</p>
		
					<definition xml:id="def-exponential-expression"><title>Exponential Expression</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								In expressions such as <m>(0.95)^n</m>, we refer to <m>0.95</m> as the base and <m>n</m> as the exponent. 
								The expression <m>(0.95)^n</m> is called a power.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
		
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									This use of 'power' and 'exponent' is used in K-12 texts. It distinguishes between components of the expression and the whole expression.
								</p>
							</li>
		
							<li>
								<p>
									It allows us to say key properties of exponentiation more clearly, for instance: 'multiplying powers means adding exponents', 'logarithms map powers to exponents', 'exponentiation maps exponents to powers'.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
		
					<fact xml:id="prop-power"><title>Power Properties: Draft</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								When <m>n</m> is a positive natural number, exponential expressions satisfy the following properties:
								<ul>
									<li>
														<p>
									(1st power) <m>a^1=a</m> (take this as definition)
								</p>
									</li>
			
									<li>
														<p>
									(product of powers property) <m>a^{x_1+x_2}=a^{x_2+x_1}=a^{x_1} a^{x_2}</m>
								</p>
									</li>
			
									<li>
														<p>
									(power of a power property) <m>(a^{x_1})^{x_2}=(a^{x_2})^{x_1}=a^{x_1 x_2}</m>
								</p>
									</li>
			
									<li>
														<p>
									(power of a product property)<m>(ab)^x=a^xb^x=b^xa^x</m>
								</p>
									</li>
			
								</ul>
							</p>
						</statement>
					</fact>
		
					<p>
						Note: The first three Power Properties allow us to say that exponent addition and multiplication are commutative, associative, and satisfy the distributive property.
					</p>

					<remark>
						<p>
							This is a rough draft for a few reasons. 
							One is that we don't specify anything about the domains of <m>a</m>, <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>. 
							These will come later.
						</p>
					</remark>

					<commentary component="instructor"><title>Instructor Note</title>
						<p>
							Many instructors find it helpful to have students submit their responses in the next activity using Google forms or something similar—choosing the option for Google forms to e-mail the responses to the person completing the form when they hit submit. 
							It is important to have the a record of all of these responses. 
							Later activities will ask the teachers to revisit their responses to these questions.

					<p>
						Mathematics teachers find themselves in teaching situations where they must speak about powers and exponents in many different ways. This activity will give you an opportunity to reflect on these sorts of situations.
					</p>

					<p>
						Classroom Scenario: Mr. Ryan teaches everything from Pre-Algebra to Calculus. The following two scenes are snapshots from his classes at different times during the year.

				</worksheet>

				<worksheet xml:id="subsec-expressions-2"><title>Activity 3 — Exponential Expressions and Power Properties in Teaching, Part 2</title>

					<p>
						Write down your thoughts on the following questions and save them. We will come back to these.
					</p>

					<question>
						<p>
							How would you evaluate the pedagogical quality of these two explanations: (a) about exponentiation and (b) about taking derivatives?
						</p>
					</question>

					<question>
						<p>
							If your evaluation depends on the context of the statement, provide some sense of why and when your evaluation might change.
						</p>
					</question>

					<commentary component="instructor"><title>Instructor note</title>
						<p>
							Give teachers a moment to read the task. 
							Ask teachers what questions they have about what they are asked to think about. 
							Say: 'Remember, this is about the EXPLANATION, not the rule.' 
							Ask again whether there are questions. 
							Then give teachers some time to write their thoughts (and possibly submit to you via a google form or chat or something like this.) 
							We will revisit this question later. 
							For reference for you, this explanation works when <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are <m>\N</m> (if we can make sense of ”<m>0</m>” copies), but not so well for any other number system.
						</p>
					</commentary>
					
				</worksheet>

				<worksheet xml:id="subsec-expressions-3"><title>Activity 3 — Exponential Expressions and Power Properties in Teaching, Part 3</title>		
					<p>
						Now, we consider an additional explanation. Here is one for the power of power property:
					</p>

					<blockquote>
											<p>
						“Let's think about <m>(b^{x_1})^{x_2}=b^{x_1x_2}</m> with a specific example. Take <m>(2^3)^5)</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						<m>(2^3)^5)</m> is five copies of <m>(2^3)</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						<m>(2^3)^5=(2^3)(2^3)(2^3)(2^3)(2^3)</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						So, the rule above says that this just equals <m>2^{3+3+3+3+3}=2^{3\times5}</m>.”
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						What numbers and/or number sets does  work for? Circle what works
					</p>

					<p>
						This explanation works when <m>x_1</m> is: <m>0 \hskip10pt -1 \hskip10pt 1/3 \hskip10pt \mathbb{N}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Z}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Q}\hskip10pt \mathbb{R}</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						This explanation works when <m>x_2</m> is: <m>0 \hskip10pt -1 \hskip10pt 1/3 \hskip10pt \mathbb{N}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Z}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Q}\hskip10pt \mathbb{R}</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						This explanation works when <m>b</m> is: <m>0 \hskip10pt -1 \hskip10pt 1/3 \hskip10pt \mathbb{N}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Z}\hskip10pt \mathbb{Q}\hskip10pt \mathbb{R}</m>
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's return to Mr. Ryan and the context for the two scenes we saw earlier.
					</p>

					<p><ul>
						<li>
											<p>
						<em>Scene 1</em> was from when the class was studying the graphs of exponential functions, more specifically, <m>y=3^x</m>. As students were plugging in values to find specific points on the graph, Mr. Ryan said, “Remember, exponents just mean repeated multiplication. Like when <m>x=4, 3^4</m> means <m>3</m> multiplied by itself four times."
					</p>
						</li>

						<li>
											<p>
						<em>Scene 2</em> was from when his Calculus class was having an end-of-year review about some of the most important ideas and results about derivatives: “If you see a function with an exponent, like <m>f(x)=2x^3</m> to take the derivative, you bring down the exponent to the front and subtract one from the exponent."
					</p>
						</li>

					</ul></p>

				</worksheet>

				<worksheet xml:id="subsec-expressions-4"><title>Activity 3 — Exponential Expressions and Power Properties in Teaching, Part 4</title>

					<question>
						<p>
							Given these contexts, give Mr. Ryan feedback about his explanations: What applies well? What could help students think more generally?
						</p>
					</question>

					<p>
						Mr. Ryan asked students to submit questions to him for homework. Some students emailed him these questions. He asks you for your ideas to respond.
					</p>

					<question>
						<p>
							One student asks: <q>Hey Mr. R, Here's my question. Why do <m>\sqrt a</m> and <m>a^{(1/2)}</m> mean the same thing? If it's a square root, why does it have to be <m>a^{(1/2)}</m> and not <m>a^{(-2)}</m> or <m>a^2</m> or something else with <m>2</m>?</q><!-- linebreak -->What ideas do you have for how Mr. Ryan should respond?
						</p>
					</question>

					<question>
						<p>
							A second student asks: <q>Yo Mr. R, are <m>-(3^x)</m> and <m>(-3)^x</m> the same thing? They seem like they should be different, but they also seem like they should the same.</q><!-- linebreak -->What ideas do you have for how Mr. Ryan should respond?
						</p>
					</question>
					
				</worksheet>

				<conclusion>
					<p>
						So far in this module, we:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									Identified Exponential Expressions and Power Properties
								</p>

							<li>
								<p>

			<section xml:id="sec-1.4"><title>Positive Natural Powers</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In this section, we further explore explaining power properties—providing opportunities for teachers to give explanations that build on ideas that students learn before high school. Mathematicians often provide explanations by way of analogy, and we use this tactic repeatedly in the remainder of this chapter. We make explicit the structure of multiplication as repeated addition, and leverage the analogous structure of exponentiation as repeated multiplication.

						</p>
					</commentary>

					<p>
						In this activity and the ones to follow, we explore different types of numbers, and how multiplication and exponentiation behave for those number types. We start with positive natural numbers.
					</p>

					<definition xml:id="def-">
						<statement>
							<p>
								When <m>n \in \mathbb{N}^+</m>, we define 
								<me>
									a^n=\underbrace{a\cdot a\cdot\dots \cdot a}_{n\ times}
								</me> 
								with repeated multiplication by <m>a</m>.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>

					<p>
						To see why the power properties hold for positive natural powers, we can make an analogy to familiar properties of multiplication of positive natural numbers. We will make graphical summaries of possible explanations based on the analogous structures we notice.

							Walk through chart together. 
							Say that although these are things that may be familiar, we are going over them so we are all on the same page with each other. 
							As well, this way of organizing our thoughts will be useful when we get to other kinds of powers. 
							Be sure that teachers notice how representations of addition and multiplication map to analogous representations of multiplication and exponentiation respectively. 
							Namely, pictures representing ones as boxes and repeated addition map nicely to the as and repeated multiplication.

							Then, choose a couple of teacher groups to share their visuals. 
							Then, ask the class, “Choose the one most different from your own and come up with a 1-minute-or-less oral explanation using that visual. 
							Talk it aloud to yourself.” 
							Students may have a difficult time creating a visual, but don't let this bog down progress too much. 
							If no student group has a suitable visual for discussion, utilize the one in the oral task below, or something similar that you create (e.g. a representation of <m>5(2 + 3)</m> compared to <m>(2 \times 3)5)</m>.

				<conclusion>

					<p>
						After completing the activities in this section, we saw a few things. First, making a chart of definitions and visual representations for multiplication and exponentiation along with their properties can be useful for organizing our thinking. 
						Second, explanations for powers and properties can be patterned after ones that students saw in middle school.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the next section, we will make charts for other number systems in the order: <m>\mathbb{Q}^+</m>, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>, and <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						We will proceed by:
						<ul>
							<li>
												<p>
							Defining numbers in that system
						</p>
							</li>

							<li>
												<p>
							Defining powers with exponents in that system

							<p>
								The notation <m>\sqrt[q]{a}</m> means a positive or zero <m>q</m>-th root of <m>a</m>, so it is another way to write <m>a^{1/q}</m>. These notations mean the same thing.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>

					<!--INSTRUCTOR NOTE HERE-->
						
					<p>
						Historically, exponential notation <m>a^x</m> was used for natural number exponents. Euclid used the term <q>power</q> to mean the square of a line segment, and Archimedes used the idea of powers to work with base 10 arithmetic. Radical notation <m>\sqrt[q]{a}</m> used for square roots, cube roots, etc. Eventually, some mathematicians realized they could unify the notation, using power properties. A <m>q</m>-th root of <m>a</m>, by definition, is a solution to <m>x^q=a</m>. Therefore, applying power properties to the notation <m>a^{1/q}</m> yields <m>(a^{1/q})^q=a^{\frac{1}{q}\cdot q}=a^1 =a</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus power properties are used to create the definition of positive rational number powers. At the same, we can also explain why these properties should hold for positive rational number powers, in analogy to properties of multiplication of positive rational numbers. The following is a graphical summary of a possible explanation of one property. Other properties hold as well, though their graphics are a bit messier.

							Be sure to provide time for teachers to discuss their answers to each of these question parts, while some of the questions in the activities can be moved along by the instructor, it is important for students to share their thinking on this question. Give teachers some time to write their thoughts (and possibly submit to you via a google form or some other means.)

					<p>
						Suppose you are teaching about rational powers. Think about each of the below ideas and write down your thoughts on how to respond.
					</p>

					<question>
						<statement>
							<p>
								You ask students the question "Where is <m>(\sqrt[6]{27})^2</m> on the number line?"
							</p>

							<p>
								What are three different strategies that students might understand and use to figure out this problem?
							</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Teachers will see this in a number of ways, and some may not see it. 
								For example, one teacher responded,
								“a6 = 27 and 33 = 27, so a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a = 27 and 3 ∗ 3 ∗ 3 = 27, so I can combine the a's to a2 ∗ a2 ∗ a2 = 27, so a2 must be 3. So the 6th root of 27 squared is 3.”
								Another teacher said, “They may also change the sixth root of 27 to be 271/6, and then if they know that a
								power raised to a power is the two numbers multiplied, they can recognize this will be 271/3 which is then 3.”
							</p>
						</solution>
					</question>

					<question>
						<statement>
							<p>
								You assign this problem to your students:
							</p>

							<p>
								"Which of the following shows a cube root of 100,000? Circle them. 
								<me>
									(\sqrt[3]{10})^5 \hspace*{30pt} 10^{3/5} \hspace*{30pt} \sqrt[3]{10^5}  \hspace*{30pt} 10^{15}  \hspace*{30pt} (100,000)^{1/3}  \hspace*{30pt} 100
								</me> 
								Also, what are other ways to right the same number?"
							</p>

							<p>
								First, solve the problem. Then write down different ways you can explain the first part (i.e., the circle the answers part).
							</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								We can test whether a number is a cube root by taking their third power. That is, for this problem, seeing if they are a solution to x3 = 100, 000
							</p>
						</solution>
					</question>

					<question>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A student asks "What if you wrote other numbers for the root? Like, if you wrote <m>\sqrt[-3]{27}</m> or <m>\sqrt[1/3]{27}</m>, what would these mean?"<!-- linebreak -->What are reasonable values for these? Why?
							</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Possible answers: Some teachers may suggest: 3
	√x means x1/3, and y
	√x means x1/y in general. So 1/3
	√27 means
	273, which 19, 683. So −3
	√27 means 27−1/3 which is 1/3.

								To approximate <m>\pi</m>, we could use its decimal expansion – we take <m>3</m>, then <m>3.1</m>, then <m>3.14</m>, then <m>3.141</m>, then <m>3.1415</m>, then <m>3.14159</m>, etc. 
								So <m>\pi</m> is the limit of 
								<me>
									3,\, 3.1,\, 3.14, \, 3.141, \, 3.1415, \, 3.14159, \dots
								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								We can do a similar thing with powers! So <m>5^\pi</m> is the limit of 
								<me>
									5^3, \, 5^{3.1},\, 5^{3.14}, \, 5^{3.141}, \, 5^{3.1415}, \, 5^{3.14159}, \dots
								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											Suppose that you are teaching about real powers, and you use <m>5^\pi</m> as an example. 
											A student asks you about power properties, and you review them using the example: 
											<me>
												5^{3.1}=5^{3+0.1}=5^{3}5^{0.1}.
											</me> 
											You ask them to break down <m>5^{3.141}</m> in a similar fashion.
										</p>

										<p>
											A student says: <q>We could do this forever! <m>5^\pi</m> is <m>5^{3}5^{0.1}5^{0.04}5^{0.001}5^{0.0005}5^{0.00009}\dots</m></q>
										</p>

										<p>
											Another student responds: <q>How did you get all those 0's? why isn't it just <m>5^{3}5^{1}5^{4}5^{1}5^{5}5^{9}\dots</m>?</q>
										</p>

										<p>
											Explain why the first student's work makes sense, and help the second student make sense of why the 0's should be there.
										</p>
									</li>

									<li>
										<p>
											A third student says: <q>Wait a minute ... if <m>5^\pi=5^{3}5^{0.1}5^{0.04}5^{0.001}5^{0.0005}5^{0.00009}\dots</m>, the exponents keep on getting smaller and smaller, so shouldn't that mean that you're multiplying by smaller and smaller numbers. 
											So each factor <m>5^{3}</m>, <m>5^{0.1}</m>, <m>5^{0.04}</m>, <m>5^{0.001}</m>, <m>5^{0.0005}</m>, <m>5^{0.00009}</m> is getting closer and closer to <m>0</m>. 
											So then <m>5^\pi</m> should be really tiny, close to 0.</q>
										</p>

										<p>
											A fourth student says: <q>I disagree, <m>5^\pi</m> should be larger than <m>5^3</m>, which is <m>125</m>. 
											That's way bigger than <m>0</m>.</q>
										</p>

										<p>
											Prepare for responding to the students. 
											In your preparations:
										</p>

										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<p>
														Help make sense of why even though <m>5^{0.1}</m>, <m>5^{0.04}</m>, <m>5^{0.001}</m>, <m>5^{0.0005}</m>, <m>5^{0.00009}</m>, …, are getting smaller and smaller, that they don't necessarily limit to <m>0</m>
													</p>
												</li>

												<li>
													<p>
														Explain what this sequence actually limits to
													</p>
												</li>

												<li>
													<p>
														Explain how to make sense of why <m>5^{3}5^{0.1}5^{0.04}5^{0.001}5^{0.0005}5^{0.00009}\dots</m> is greater than <m>125</m>.
