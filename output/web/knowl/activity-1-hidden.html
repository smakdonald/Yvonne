<body class="ignore-math"><article class="activity project-like"><div class="para">This activity uses a Three Act Math Task to motivate the material in this chapter. Math Three Acts use mathematical storytelling to motivate learning. Basically, Act I is meant to activate mathematical curiosity and set up a conflict / problem to solve, Act II develops tools for solving the conflict / problem, and Act III resolves the mathematical conflict / problem and sets up a sequel!
