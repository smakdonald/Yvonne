<div class="para">Suppose that you are teaching about real powers, and you use <span class="process-math">\(5^\pi\)</span> as an example. A student asks you about power properties, and you review them using the example:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
5^{3.1}=5^{3+0.1}=5^{3}5^{0.1}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">You ask them to break down <span class="process-math">\(5^{3.141}\)</span> in a similar fashion.</div>

<div class="para">A student says: “We could do this forever! <span class="process-math">\(5^\pi\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(5^{3}5^{0.1}5^{0.04}5^{0.001}5^{0.0005}5^{0.00009}\dots\)</span>”</div>
<div class="para">Another student responds: “How did you get all those 0's? why isn't it just <span class="process-math">\(5^{3}5^{1}5^{4}5^{1}5^{5}5^{9}\dots\text{?}\)</span>”</div>
<div class="para">Explain why the first student's work makes sense, and help the second student make sense of why the 0's should be there.</div>

<div class="para">A third student says: “Wait a minute ... if <span class="process-math">\(5^\pi=5^{3}5^{0.1}5^{0.04}5^{0.001}5^{0.0005}5^{0.00009}\dots\text{,}\)</span> the exponents keep on getting smaller and smaller, so shouldn't that mean that you're multiplying by smaller and smaller numbers. So each factor <span class="process-math">\(5^{3}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5^{0.1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5^{0.04}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5^{0.001}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5^{0.0005}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5^{0.00009}\)</span> is getting closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> So then <span class="process-math">\(5^\pi\)</span> should be really tiny, close to 0.”</div>
<div class="para">A fourth student says: “I disagree, <span class="process-math">\(5^\pi\)</span> should be larger than <span class="process-math">\(5^3\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(125\text{.}\)</span> That's way bigger than <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>”</div>
