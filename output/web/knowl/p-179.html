<div class="para">Teachers will see this in a number of ways, and some may not see it. For example, one teacher responded, “a6 = 27 and 33 = 27, so a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a ∗ a = 27 and 3 ∗ 3 ∗ 3 = 27, so I can combine the a's to a2 ∗ a2 ∗ a2 = 27, so a2 must be 3. So the 6th root of 27 squared is 3.” Another teacher said, “They may also change the sixth root of 27 to be 271/6, and then if they know that a power raised to a power is the two numbers multiplied, they can recognize this will be 271/3 which is then 3.”</div>
