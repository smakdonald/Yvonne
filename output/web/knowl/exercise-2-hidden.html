<div class="para">Something we discussed in this section is explaining numbers using location and movement. Some middle school teachers have found it fun and helpful to visualize the movement as skateboarding and to think about recording someone skateboarding. Here:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is like a video of someone skateboarding forward from <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> unit.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is like a video of someone skateboarding forward from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> units.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> is like a video of someone skateboarding backwards <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> unit.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(-n\)</span> is like a video of someone skateboarding backwards <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> units.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Multiplying something by <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> is like playing the video of something, backwards!</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para">Using this idea, how would you explain why it makes sense that <span class="process-math">\(-1\times -1\)</span> should equal <span class="process-math">\(1\text{?}\)</span> Complete this dialogue.</div> <div class="para">You: “Think about what it means to take <span class="process-math">\(-1\times 5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1\times -1\text{.}\)</span>” Student 1: “So if you play a video of me going forward <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> units, but you play the video backwards, then it looks like I am going backwards <span class="process-math">\(5\text{!}\)</span> And that’s <span class="process-math">\(-5\text{.}\)</span>” Student 2: “Okay, so for the other one. <span class="process-math">\(-1\times -1\text{.}\)</span> Wait, so if you play the video backwards, but let’s say I was going backward in the video …My brain hurts. What does it mean to play a video backwards of someone skating backwards?” You: “Let’s think about this together. ………”</div></article></body>
