<em class="emphasis">Scene 2</em> was from when his Calculus class was having an end-of-year review about some of the most important ideas and results about derivatives: “If you see a function with an exponent, like <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=2x^3\)</span> to take the derivative, you bring down the exponent to the front and subtract one from the exponent."</div></li>
