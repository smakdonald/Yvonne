<div class="para">The brilliant twelfth-century Muslim mathematician Ibn Yaha al-Maghribi Al-Samawa'al came close to developing modern power notation in his algebra text <em class="emphasis">al-Bahir fi'l-jabr</em> (The Brilliant in Algebra). In many respects, this text was centuries ahead of its time, but it found little traction outside of the Islamic world. Some of the ideas appearing in this work (such as polynomial division and considering <span class="process-math">\(1/a\)</span> to be a power of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>) would not be systematically tackled in the West until the 1600's.</div>
